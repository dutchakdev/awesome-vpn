# Contribution Guidelines for [Your Repository Name]

This resource is a collaborative effort by the community, and we greatly appreciate [all contributors](https://github.com/dutchakdev/awesome-vpn/graphs/contributors).

## Contribution Process

We welcome your contributions, but we have some rules to maintain the quality of the packages and resources listed here. Please note that all reviews are not personal feedback, even if you are reviewing your own contribution. We aim to do our best to meet your expectations.

- To add, remove, or modify entries on the list, please submit a pull request.

## About Our Repository

- This repository is a curated list of high-quality, actively maintained VPN-related packages, tools, and resources.
- We encourage you to contribute links to packages/projects that you have used or are familiar with. This helps ensure the quality of the entries.

## Quality Standards

To be listed in this repository, project repositories should adhere to the following quality standards:

- **Open Source License**: The project should have an open-source license. See the list of allowed licenses [here](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical).
- **Functionality**: The project should function as documented and expected.
- **Usefulness**: The project should be generally useful to the wider community of VPN users.
- **Active Maintenance**: The project should be actively maintained, with regular commits. For completed projects, issues and pull requests should be responded to within a reasonable time frame.
- **Stability**: The project should be stable or progressing toward stability.
- **Documentation**: The project should be thoroughly documented in the English language, including README files, pkg.go.dev doc comments, and so on. All public functions and types should have Go-style documentation headers.
- **Test Coverage**: If the project is testable, it should have test coverage of at least 80% for non-data-related packages and at least 90% for data-related packages. Tests will be reviewed, and coverage should not be based solely on benchmark results.
- **Versioned Releases**: The project should have at least one official version-numbered release that allows go.mod files to list the file by version number (e.g., vX.X.X).

## Maintainers

To ensure thorough review, we have a team of maintainers. Every pull request must be reviewed by at least one maintainer before merging. You can find the list of maintainers in the [MAINTAINERS](MAINTAINERS) file.

## Reporting Issues

Please open an issue if you have suggestions for improvements or if you notice any issues with the listed packages or projects. We value your input and aim to make this list a valuable resource for the community.

## Decision-Making Process

The official group of maintainers has the final decision on accepting pull requests. Discussions are conducted openly in issues, and decisions are made by consensus.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community. You don't need permission or inclusion in the maintainers list to review a contribution and mark it as LGTM (Looks Good To Me). Please read our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) carefully before contributing.
